# AstroSwiftCore

AstroSwiftCore provides Swift support for the Astro UX Design System on iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, macOS, and tvOS

AstroSwiftCore provides Astro's four core UI color palettes. It is unlikey that an application will need access to these raw color values. Instead, applications should use the semantic UI colors found in the AstroSwiftFoundation package.
