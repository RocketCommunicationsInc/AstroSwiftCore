# AstroSwiftCore

AstroSwiftCore provides Swift support for the Astro UX Design System on iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, macOS, and tvOS

AstroSwiftCore provides Astro's core color palettes. It is unlikey that an application will need access to these colors. Instead, applications should use the semantic UI colors found in the AstroSwiftFoundation package.

New in 2.0:
â€¢ Reorganized color palletes to match Astro 7.
