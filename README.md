# AstroSwiftCore

AstroSwiftCore is a Swift Package that brings the core color palettes of the Astro Space UX Design system to Apple platforms. AstroSwiftCore works with iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS.

Note that few applications will need access to these core color palettes. Instead applications should use the semantic colors found in AstroSwiftFoundation, the mainstream Astro Package for Swift.

To use AstroSwiftCore in your Xcode project, select File->Swift Packages->Add Package Dependency, and enter the URL of this repository.
